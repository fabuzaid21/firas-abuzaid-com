We showed that many resource allocation problems in computer systems---such as
traffic engineering, cluster scheduling, and query load-balancing---can be
classified as _granular_ mathematical optimization problems. Such problems can
be solved much more efficiently using random partitioning, which only
introduces a small approximation error. In our experiments, POP achieved
allocations within 1.5% of optimality with orders-of-magnitude improvements in
runtime.
