Howdy! I’m Firas Abuzaid; thanks for visiting my website. I'm a 2nd-year Ph.D.
student in Computer Science at Stanford University, co-advised by {% ext_link
Matei Zaharia http://cs.stanford.edu/~matei %} and {% ext_link Peter Bailis
http://www.bailis.org %}.

As a member of the {% ext_link FutureData Systems Group  http://www.futuredata.io/ %} and
the {% ext_link Stanford Infolab http://infolab.stanford.edu/ %}, I focus on the
intersection of systems and machine learning: how to take high-level artificial
intelligence or machine learning tasks and build software systems to improve
the efficiency of these tasks without sacrificing their accuracy.

I spent the first year of my Ph.D. at {% ext_link MIT CSAIL http://csail.mit.edu %},
working under Matei Zaharia and {% ext_link Sam Madden http://db.csail.mit.edu/madden/ %}
as part of the {% ext_link MIT DB group http://db.csail.mit.edu/ %}.

Prior to MIT, I was at Stanford—yes, really!—where I completed my B.S. and M.S. in Computer Science.
I worked with {% ext_link Chris Ré http://www.cs.stanford.edu/people/chrismre/ %} on database systems
and machine learning systems.
