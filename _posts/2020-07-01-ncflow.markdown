In this project, we developed a new algorithm for Traffic Engineering that
solves the Multi-commodity Maximum Total Flow problem on Wide-Area Networks
(WANs) much more efficiently, with only a small loss of flow. Our algorithm i)
contracts the WAN into disjoint clusters, ii) solves a simpler flow problem on
the contracted network, and iii) solves the per-cluster flow problems in
parallel.  We benchmarked NCFlow on WAN topologies that are over 10x larger
than those considered in prior work and found it to be 8.2x faster than the
state of the art in the median case (and up to 4,000x), while allocating 98.8%
of the total flow and using 6x fewer forwarding entries.
