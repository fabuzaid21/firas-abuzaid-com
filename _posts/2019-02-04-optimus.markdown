In this paper, we show that blocked matrix multiply---a naive,
hardware-optimized approach---surprisingly outperforms the state-of-the-art
MIPS solvers by up to 12x for some (but not all) inputs.  In response, we
present a novel MIPS solution, Maximus, that takes advantage of hardware
efficiency _and_ pruning of the search space; we also introduce a new
data-dependent optimizer, Optimus, that selects online with minimal overhead
the best MIPS solver for a given set of inputs. Together, Optimus and Maximus
outperform state-of-the-art MIPS solvers by 3.2x on average, and up to 10.9x,
on widely studied MIPS datasets.
