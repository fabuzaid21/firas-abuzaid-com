Hi, Iâ€™m Firas Abuzaid; thanks for visiting my website! I am co-founder and CTO
of {% ext_link Neo.Tax https://neo.tax %}, a startup that automates taxes for
small businesses.

I graduated from Stanford University in August 2022 with a Ph.D. in Computer
Science, where I was co-advised by {% ext_link Matei Zaharia
http://cs.stanford.edu/~matei %} and {% ext_link Peter Bailis
http://www.bailis.org %}. You can find my dissertation

At Stanford, I was a member of the {% ext_link FutureData Systems Group

https://dawn.stanford.edu %}. I spent the first year of my Ph.D. at {% ext_link
MIT CSAIL http://csail.mit.edu %}, co-advised by Matei and {% ext_link Sam Madden http://db.csail.mit.edu/madden/ %}
as part of the {% ext_link MIT DB group http://db.csail.mit.edu/ %}.

During my Ph.D., I focused on a few different research areas: systems and
machine learning, databases and data analytics, ML applications for medicine,
and computer networking. You can check out my Google Scholar profile {%
