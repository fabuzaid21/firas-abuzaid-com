In this collaboration with Dr. Sanjiv Narayan's [Computational Arrhythmia
Research
Laboratory](http://web.stanford.edu/group/narayanlab/cgi-bin/wordpress/), we
demonstrate that convolutional neural networks can identify potential treatment sites
for atrial fibrillation, a common form of heart arrhythmia. In our evaluation,
we show that CNNs can identify these sites with 95.0% accuracy.
